# Hollywood: Most Profitable Stories PowerBI Dashboard
![](https://github.com/Ajay96700/Hollywood-Most-Profitable-Movies/blob/main/Dashboard%20Image.png)

## This dashboard has 3 Tabs and 2 Pages:

Dashboard (Page 1): Quickly see the highest worldwide grossing films for each year. Click on "See All >" and it takes you to...
All Films (Page 2): View all films by year along with audience votes. I Love how visual this looks with movie posters and like %!

Film Details Tab: Get everything about a film at a glance — audience & Rotten Tomatoes scores, summary, genre, studio, gross value, and profit ratio. To make it interactive, I’ve used movie posters as images.

Analytics Tab: This is where the insights really shine.
Column chart: Audience vs. Rotten Tomatoes scores (top 10 films, year-wise)
Scatter chart: Film count vs. gross value & profit ratio
Donut chart: Genre distribution
Tree map: Number of films by production house (super helpful for comparisons at a glance!)

I have optimized Bookmarks while creating this Dashboard.
